# School District Analysis

## Overview
In general, this analysis was intended to demonstrate the differences in math & reading scores when you consider factors like grade, school, school-type, school-size, and spending. However, since we found out that there were allegations of academic dishonesty, this particular analysis sought to find any discrepancies with this data when filtering out the results from 9th graders at Thomas High School. While we do not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, the school-board would still like to replace all the Thomas 9th grade values with null values to take note of any differences. 
  
## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
